# Edge-detection-module-based-on-sobel-operator
This module is implemented by Verilog,so it has good portability.

It should be noted that when porting this project, the write depth of the fifo module needs to be greater than twice the number of input pixels in the first line.And this module only supports RGB565 inputs.
